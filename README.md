# mod-llm-chatter

**Every hero has a story. Your companions are ready to tell theirs.**

A fantasy roleplay conversation engine for [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) WotLK (3.3.5a) and [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots). It replaces the silence of automated bots with personality-driven, lore-grounded dialogue, giving every companion a voice shaped by their race, class, and the world around them. Whether you're soloing through the cursed woods of Duskwood, descending into the titan halls of Ulduar with a full raid, or clashing over flags in Warsong Gulch, your party feels like a band of adventurers sharing a journey through Azeroth.

Built from the ground up for **fantasy roleplay immersion**. Every system, personalities, memories, prompts, spatial awareness, is designed to keep bots speaking as inhabitants of Azeroth, not as AI assistants breaking the fourth wall.

## Features

* **Roleplay-First Personalities**: Every bot is a distinct character in Azeroth's story. Their dialogue is deeply rooted in their race, class, and assigned personality traits, dynamically enhanced by their specialized talent builds. Bots stay in character, a Forsaken warlock speaks nothing like a Draenei paladin, and both draw from the lore and culture of their people to feel like living, breathing inhabitants of the world.
* **Persistent Personality & Memories**: Your companions remember you. Each bot carries a unique, permanent personality. Every dungeon you clear together, every boss you defeat, every achievement you earn, every level milestone, all of it is written into that bot's memory as a personal journal entry. The next time you group up, they might reference that time you wiped in Shadowfang Keep, or fondly recall discovering a hidden corner of Teldrassil together. Your relationship with each companion deepens over time, building the kind of shared history that makes a party of adventurers feel like old friends reunited at an inn.
* **Background Stories**: Every bot has an origin. When a companion first joins your group, the LLM generates a short background story rooted in their race, class, and personality traits — where they were born, who raised them, and the events that shaped who they are. A blood elf mage might carry the scars of Silvermoon's fall; a dwarf warrior might have learned to fight in the pits beneath Ironforge. These backstories are persistent, surviving across sessions, and are occasionally woven into idle chatter and ambient dialogue, giving bots a subtle sense of personal history without ever breaking the flow of conversation. View and regenerate backstories anytime through the Chatter Companion addon.
* **Deep Spatial & Lore Awareness**: Bots possess an intimate understanding of their surroundings, maintaining full awareness of both the broader world zones and the specific subzones within them. Whether you are wandering the vibrant paths of Elwynn Forest, traversing the vast snows of Dragonblight, or delving into the ancient mysteries of the Ruins of Mathystra in Darkshore, bots draw from over 3,000 unique descriptions to comment on the history, magic, and atmosphere of your exact location. In cities, they notice when you enter a new district, walking into the Cenarion Enclave or Krasus' Landing prompts a natural comment about the surroundings.
* **Conscious World Sensing**: The world is alive, and your companions notice it. Bots dynamically react to everything in their vicinity, from wildlife and rare creatures to NPCs, ancient ruins, weathered statues, and eerie altars. They also observe functional points of interest like moonwells, crackling fireplaces, and bustling forges, while adapting to weather changes, the time of day, arriving zeppelins, and seasonal holidays.
* **Organic Party Interactivity**: Your companions don't just follow; they interact. They will strike up multi-bot conversations, ask you unprompted questions about your journey, and react authentically to combat, loot, and quest milestones. Seamlessly integrated with the game's emote and voice systems, bots punctuate their dialogue with physical gestures and audible character voices, bringing an extra layer of life to everything from the thrill of an achievement to quiet banter by the campfire.
* **A Living, Breathing World**: The immersion extends beyond your immediate party. The open world's General channel hums with ambient bot chatter, reacting to real player messages and world events. Guards, vendors, trainers, and citizens engage in proximity `/say` conversations as you walk past, your party bots join in too, slipping naturally between party chat and the world around them. In battlegrounds, bots shout tactical callouts rooted in faction pride, while in raids, they brace for encounters across 148 iconic bosses, sharing lore and rallying morale between pulls.
* **Guild Hall Camaraderie**: Beyond the party and the open world,
  your guild feels like a real group of adventurers instead of a silent
  roster. Guildmates share stories, trade jokes, voice their opinions,
  and fall into conversations of their own. Speak in Guild Chat and
  they answer as familiar companions, remembering what has been said
  and carrying shared threads forward naturally. When you return to
  Azeroth, a warm welcome from your guild helps make the channel feel
  like a community that was already alive before you arrived.
* **Seamless Fantasy Immersion**: Designed to preserve the roleplay atmosphere, the module features smart pacing, multi-character conversation flow, and natural reading delays. No repetitive robotic spam, no fourth-wall breaks, just natural, in-character dialogue that deepens the fantasy of adventuring through Azeroth.
* **Zero Server Impact**: All LLM processing runs in a separate bridge service with a thread-pool worker model. The game server simply drops event rows into the database and moves on, never waiting on an API call. Responses flow back through the same queue and are delivered on the next world tick, keeping your server performance completely unaffected.

## Quick Start

1. Clone into `modules/` and build AzerothCore
2. Copy `conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to your config directory and name it `mod_llm_chatter.conf`
3. Set your LLM provider and the matching API key (`LLMChatter.Anthropic.ApiKey`, `LLMChatter.OpenAI.ApiKey`, `LLMChatter.Google.ApiKey`, `LLMChatter.OpenRouter.ApiKey`, or no key when using Ollama)
4. Start worldserver once, or run `dbimport`, so AzerothCore applies the module's character database schema
5. Start the Python bridge
6. Play, bots start chatting when grouped with players

See [Setup](#setup) below for detailed Docker, non-Docker, and SQL preparation steps.

## Compatibility

This module requires a working AzerothCore server with mod-playerbots. If you don't have one yet, start here:

- [AzerothCore Docker install guide](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/install-with-docker)
- [AzerothCore Playerbot branch](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk/tree/Playerbot)
- [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots)

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| AzerothCore | [Playerbot branch](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk/tree/Playerbot) (WotLK 3.3.5a) |
| mod-playerbots | [liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots) |
| Python | 3.10+ |
| LLM Provider | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, or Ollama |

Install the Python bridge dependencies from `tools/requirements.txt`.
Anthropic deployments use the supported 1.x SDK; installing provider
packages individually can bypass the module's compatibility constraints.

### Recommended Models

Tested extensively with excellent results:
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** (Anthropic),  fast, affordable, excellent quality
- **GPT-4o-mini** (OpenAI),  great alternative, similar cost
- **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** (Google),  fast, cheap, tested with
  structured chatter and pre-cache JSON
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Google),  reliable with
  `LLMChatter.Google.ThinkingBudget = 0`
- **GPT-4.1-mini** (OpenAI),  a little more expensive, but tested with
  fantastic quality and speed
- **OpenRouter model slugs** such as `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`,
  `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, and `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`, useful when users
  want OpenRouter routing while keeping OpenAI-compatible calls

Ollama is supported for local/free inference, but the module's advanced prompt architecture (structured JSON responses, system/user message separation, emote and action fields) demands strong instruction-following capabilities that smaller open-source models may not consistently deliver. For the best experience, we recommend Claude Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, or equivalent fast OpenRouter-hosted models such as Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-4o-mini, or GPT-4.1-mini. See the config file header for provider setup details.

### Tuning the Chattiness

The default config ships on the **chatty side** so you can
experience all the features out of the box. If you prefer a
quieter, more immersive atmosphere, the key knobs are below.

**Reducing General channel chatter** (ambient bot conversations
in zone-wide chat):

```ini
# How often each zone is checked for ambient chatter
LLMChatter.TriggerIntervalSeconds = 60  # default 30, try 60-90

# Chance per check that bots start talking unprompted
LLMChatter.TriggerChance = 10            # default 15, try 5-10

# Chance that ambient chatter becomes a multi-bot conversation
LLMChatter.ConversationChance = 30      # default 40, try 15-20

# World event reactions (weather, transports, holidays)
LLMChatter.EventReactionChance = 10     # default 25, try 10-15
```

**Reducing party chatter** (group chat while questing):

```ini
# Idle chatter frequency and cooldown
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleCheckInterval = 60  # default 30
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleChance = 10          # default 15
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.IdleCooldown = 90       # default 40

# Quest reactions (accept, objectives, turn-in)
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestAcceptChance = 30    # default 50
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestObjectiveChance = 30 # default 50
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.QuestCompleteChance = 30  # default 50

# Combat reactions
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.KillChanceNormal = 5    # default 20
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.SpellCastChance = 10    # default 30

# Nearby object/creature comments
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.NearbyObjectChance = 5  # default 20
```

All values are percentages (0-100) unless noted. Setting any
chance to `0` disables that trigger entirely. See the config
file comments for the full list of tunable keys.

### Tuning Bot Memory

Memory works out of the box and needs no tuning. These keys are here for
admins who want bots to remember more (or less), or who care about what the
memory system costs in LLM calls.

**How much a bot remembers about one player:**

```ini
# Active memories kept per bot-player pair. Higher = longer history,
# slightly bigger prompts and a bit more background tidying work.
LLMChatter.Memory.MaxPerBotPlayer = 30

# Minutes a group has to last before that session's memories are kept
# at all. Raise it if you don't want brief invites leaving traces.
LLMChatter.Memory.SessionMinutes = 3

# Memories at or below this score fade with age; anything higher never
# fades. DecayDays is how long one point of fading takes.
LLMChatter.Memory.DecayMaxImportance = 3
LLMChatter.Memory.DecayDays = 30
```

**Keeping the cost modest.** Memories, condensed notes and relationship
summaries are never shown to a player word-for-word — they're stored, fed back
in as context, and reworded by the main model before anything reaches chat. So
all of that work can be routed to a cheaper "quick" model instead of your
main one — it's opt-in, not automatic:

```ini
# Requires LLMChatter.QuickAnalyze.Provider and .Model to be set below;
# does nothing (falls back to the main model) if either is left empty.
LLMChatter.Memory.UseQuickModel = 1
```

**How tidying (condensation) works.** Rather than deleting the oldest memory
whenever the cap is hit, a bot folds a few of its least meaningful memories of
you into one short note. It starts doing this *before* the cap is reached, so
nothing has to be thrown away:

```ini
LLMChatter.Memory.Condensation.Enable = 1

# Start tidying once a pair is this % full (80% of MaxPerBotPlayer).
LLMChatter.Memory.Condensation.TriggerPercent = 80

# Memories at or above this importance are never tidied. Lower it and
# more gets summarized away; raise it and bots keep more verbatim detail.
LLMChatter.Memory.Condensation.ProtectFloor = 7
```

Four further keys (`Condensation.MinCandidates`, `.MaxCandidates`,
`.MaxDigests` and `.MaxGenerations`) control how gradual the tidying is. The
defaults are deliberately conservative — see the config file comments if you
want to change them.

Set `Condensation.Enable = 0` to turn tidying off entirely — memories are then
simply evicted at the cap instead, oldest and least meaningful first.

**Relationship summaries** (the "how this bot feels about you" line):

```ini
LLMChatter.Memory.Relationship.Enable = 1

# New memories needed before the summary is rewritten. Raise it for
# fewer LLM calls, lower it for a faster-evolving relationship.
LLMChatter.Memory.Relationship.UpdateThreshold = 5

LLMChatter.Memory.Relationship.MaxChars = 400
```

**Group mood (the "vibe")** — how long a party stays in the mood of something
that just happened, and how big a moment has to be to set it:

```ini
# Seconds a mood lingers. Raise it for moods that carry across a whole
# dungeon; lower it for a party that resets quickly.
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.VibeDurationSeconds = 600

# Importance a memory must reach to set the mood (1-10). Raise it so
# only genuinely big moments change the party's tone.
LLMChatter.GroupChatter.VibeImportanceThreshold = 5
```

**Maintenance.** Memories and relationship summaries belonging to deleted
characters are cleaned up automatically every 24 hours. A GM can also run it on
demand in-game with `.llmc memoryclean` (in-game only — it is not available
from the server console).

### Known Limitations
- **Ollama / open-source models**: Local inference requires fast hardware (sub-5s responses). Models below 8B frequently produce malformed JSON, ignore length constraints, or echo prompt instructions. Cloud-hosted Ollama models vary in quality — reasoning models (deepseek, qwen3.5, glm) are incompatible. For reliable results, use Claude Haiku or GPT-4o-mini
- Ollama cloud models add routing overhead compared to direct Anthropic/OpenAI APIs

## Setup

### Important: Disable Default Bot Chat

This module **replaces** built-in playerbot chat. Add to `playerbots.conf`:

```ini
AiPlayerbot.EnableBroadcasts = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotTalk = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotEmote = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSuggestDungeons = 0
AiPlayerbot.EnableGreet = 0
AiPlayerbot.GuildFeedback = 0
AiPlayerbot.RandomBotSayWithoutMaster = 0
```

### Docker

**1. Configure**

Copy `modules/mod-llm-chatter/conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to `env/dist/etc/modules/` and rename it to `mod_llm_chatter.conf`. Open it in a text editor and set at minimum:
- `LLMChatter.Provider`,  choose `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `openrouter`, or `ollama`
- the matching provider API key, for example `LLMChatter.OpenRouter.ApiKey` when using OpenRouter (not needed for Ollama)

**2. Add bridge to docker-compose.override.yml**
```yaml
services:
  ac-llm-chatter-bridge:
    container_name: ac-llm-chatter-bridge
    image: python:3.11-slim
    networks:
      - ac-network
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    command: >
      bash -c "
        pip install --quiet -r /app/requirements.txt &&
        python llm_chatter_bridge.py --config /config/mod_llm_chatter.conf
      "
    volumes:
      - ./modules/mod-llm-chatter/tools:/app:ro
      - ./env/dist/etc/modules:/config:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      ac-database:
        condition: service_healthy
    profiles: [dev]
```

**3. Initialize character tables**

The chatter bridge does not create database tables. AzerothCore imports
the module SQL automatically when worldserver or `dbimport` runs, but
the bridge can fail on a fresh database if it starts first.

On a fresh install, either start worldserver once before starting the
bridge, or import the base character schema manually after the database
container is running:

```bash
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_characters < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql
```

**4. Load talent data (optional)**

Populates talent and spell lookup tables that give the LLM richer context
about each bot's specialization. Worldserver treats `talenttab_dbc` rows as
runtime DBC overrides, so the included masks and ordering match the WotLK
3.3.5a client DBC.

```bash
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/world/base/llm_chatter_talent_dbc.sql
```

**5. Start**
```bash
docker compose --profile dev up -d
```

### Non-Docker

**1. Build**,  place this repo under `modules/` and rebuild AzerothCore.

**2. Configure**

Copy `conf/mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist` to your server's config directory (typically `etc/modules/`) and rename it to `mod_llm_chatter.conf`. Open it in a text editor and set at minimum:
- `LLMChatter.Provider`,  choose `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `openrouter`, or `ollama`
- the matching provider API key, for example `LLMChatter.OpenRouter.ApiKey` when using OpenRouter (not needed for Ollama)

**3. Initialize character tables**

The chatter bridge does not create database tables. AzerothCore imports
the module SQL automatically when worldserver or `dbimport` runs, but
the bridge can fail on a fresh database if it starts first.

On a fresh install, either start worldserver once before starting the
bridge, or import the base character schema manually:

```bash
mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_characters < \
  data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql
```

**4. Start the bridge**
```bash
cd tools/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python llm_chatter_bridge.py --config /path/to/mod_llm_chatter.conf
```

**5. Load talent data (optional)**

Populates talent and spell lookup tables that give the LLM richer context
about each bot's specialization. Worldserver treats `talenttab_dbc` rows as
runtime DBC overrides, so the included masks and ordering match the WotLK
3.3.5a client DBC.

```bash
mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_world < \
  data/sql/world/base/llm_chatter_talent_dbc.sql
```

**6. Start or keep worldserver running.**

---

## Screenshot Vision

> This feature is **experimental** and **optional**. Everything else works without it.

Screenshot Vision lets your bots react to what's actually on your screen. A small helper program runs alongside your game, takes a screenshot every now and then, and asks a cheap AI model to describe what it sees. The description is then fed to your bots so they can comment on the scenery in party chat.

### What you need

- **Windows** (the helper runs on the same machine as your WoW client)
- **Python 3.10+** installed on your machine (not inside Docker)
- **An OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o-mini is recommended — extremely cheap) or an Anthropic key

### Step-by-step setup

**1. Install the required Python packages**

Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:

```
pip install mss Pillow openai mysql-connector-python pywin32
```

If you want to use Claude instead of GPT-4o-mini, also install `anthropic`:
```
pip install anthropic
```

**2. Run the database migration**

If you're upgrading from a previous version (fresh installs can skip this):

```bash
# Docker
docker exec -i ac-database mysql -uroot -ppassword acore_characters < \
  modules/mod-llm-chatter/data/sql/characters/updates/20260329_screenshot_event_type.sql
```

**3. Add the screenshot settings to your config**

Open your `mod_llm_chatter.conf` and add these lines at the bottom (or copy them from `mod_llm_chatter.conf.dist`):

```ini
# Enable the feature
LLMChatter.Screenshot.Enable = 1

# How often to capture (seconds). Default: every 45-120 seconds
LLMChatter.Screenshot.IntervalMinSeconds = 45
LLMChatter.Screenshot.IntervalMaxSeconds = 120

# Chance (1-100) to actually process each capture. Default: 90
LLMChatter.Screenshot.Chance = 90

# Which AI to use for analyzing screenshots
# Options: "openai" (recommended), "anthropic", "google", or "openrouter"
LLMChatter.Screenshot.VisionProvider = openai

# Which model to use. GPT-4o-mini is fast and very cheap
LLMChatter.Screenshot.VisionModel = gpt-4o-mini

# Chance (1-100) that a screenshot triggers a multi-bot
# conversation instead of a single comment. Default: 40
LLMChatter.Screenshot.ConversationChance = 40

# Database host override for the host-side agent.
# Your bridge uses a Docker hostname (like ac-database) that
# your Windows machine can't reach. Set this to 127.0.0.1
LLMChatter.Screenshot.DBHost = 127.0.0.1
```

Make sure your config also has the matching API key set (`LLMChatter.OpenAI.ApiKey`, `LLMChatter.Anthropic.ApiKey`, `LLMChatter.Google.ApiKey`, or `LLMChatter.OpenRouter.ApiKey`).

**4. Restart the chatter bridge**

```bash
docker restart ac-llm-chatter-bridge
```

**5. Start the screenshot agent**

Open a new terminal window and run:

```
python modules/mod-llm-chatter/tools/screenshot_agent.py --config env/dist/etc/modules/mod_llm_chatter.conf
```

Keep this window open while you play. The agent will quietly capture screenshots in the background and your bots will start making observations about the scenery.

**6. Play the game!**

Make sure WoW is in the foreground (the agent only captures when WoW is the active window). Group up with some bots, and within a couple of minutes you should see them commenting on what they see around them.

### Tips

- The agent saves screenshots to `modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/screenshots/` so you can see exactly what the AI is analyzing
- If bots aren't saying anything, check that the agent terminal shows `Queued observation:` messages
- Cost is roughly **$0.05-0.10 per hour** of play with GPT-4o-mini
- You can stop the agent at any time (Ctrl+C) — the rest of the module continues working normally

## Upgrading

> **First-time installing the module? Skip this section.**
> The base schema in
> `data/sql/characters/base/00000000_llm_chatter_tables.sql`
> already contains everything every migration adds. Fresh installs do
> **not** need the dated migration files below after the base schema has
> been applied. That can happen automatically through worldserver or
> `dbimport`, or manually with the setup command above if the bridge is
> started before worldserver.

**Existing installs** must apply migration scripts manually
when updating to a newer version. Migrations live in
`data/sql/characters/updates/` and are named by date:

Migrations are idempotent — safe to run on an already
up-to-date database. Run them in date order after each
`git pull` that includes new migration files.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No chatter appearing | Check `Enable = 1`, API key set, bots in zone with player |
| Group chat not working | Set `GroupChatter.Enable = 1`, must have bots in party |
| BG chatter not working | Set `BGChatter.Enable = 1`, join WSG/AB/EY with bots |
| Raid chatter not working | Set `RaidChatter.Enable = 1`, raid group in supported instance |
| Too much / too little chatter | Tune chance and cooldown settings in config |
| Ollama slow responses | Try a smaller model or use a cloud provider |

### Bots won't chat? Check the health report

You don't need to run anything. Every time the bridge starts, it
runs a built-in health check and prints a simple **PASS / FAIL**
report. Just look at the bridge's startup output:

- **Docker:** the bridge window, or run `docker logs ac-llm-chatter-bridge`
- **Non-Docker:** the bridge's console output

A copy of the report is also saved to
`modules/mod-llm-chatter/logs/healthcheck.log`, so you can open it
like a normal text file.

If something is misconfigured, the report names the problem in plain
language and tells you how to fix it. It checks:

- the config file loads and the module is enabled
- the database connection — wrong username/password, unreachable
  host, or wrong database name
- the required tables exist
- the LLM provider and API key — missing key, a leftover example
  placeholder, an invalid key, or an unreachable local model

A failing check looks like this:

```
[FAIL] LLM provider config
      The anthropic API key is still the example placeholder.
      -> Replace the placeholder in LLMChatter.Anthropic.ApiKey with your real key.
```

Fix the items marked `[FAIL]`, restart the bridge, and check that
every line now shows `[PASS]`. If they all pass and bots still don't
talk, see the table above.

> The check runs automatically by default. It can be turned off with
> `LLMChatter.HealthCheck.Enable = 0`, and the live LLM test call can
> be disabled with `LLMChatter.HealthCheck.LLMProbe = 0`.

**Check logs:** `docker logs ac-llm-chatter-bridge --since 5m`
